1
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,792
Do you need a hand?

2
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,833
Move in further.

3
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,333
Come. Come over here.

4
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:01,792
All right.

5
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,750
You need to buy a ticket.

6
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,125
Is there no discount?

7
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,625
Don't block my way.

8
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,917
Have you found it yet?
Just pay for the ticket.

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,375
-Stop wasting my time.
-Can you check the others first?

10
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,583
-I will show you my ticket once I find it.
-No.

11
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:17,708
Just give me a second.

12
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,208
I know, you won't find it.

13
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:22,000
I've seen plenty of people who act
like they have lost their ticket.

14
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,667
Just buy the ticket from me
at its original price

15
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,250
or the officer will show up
and issue you a fine.

16
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,833
I still have to find my ticket
regardless of who will show up.

17
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,500
-I bought the ticket.
-Let me find it.

18
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,208
-Come to the eighth coach.
<i>-Roger that.

19
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:35,250
-You--
-Miss!

20
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,583
This ticket belongs to you, right?

21
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:04,958
I've boarded the plane.

22
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:08,125
I can deliver the signed contract on time.

23
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,917
It's all good.

24
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,917
Hello, sir. Welcome aboard.

25
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:27,042
Hello, ma'am. Please fasten your seatbelt.
Thank you.

26
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,208
Here. Look at this.
I bought the ticket. I really did.

27
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:15,792
Are you from Yaojiang, too?

28
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,708
-Could you help pass the noodle?
-The three of us are from Yaojiang.

29
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,833
-Thank you.
-We haven't seen you before.

30
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,792
I have been out of town for years.

31
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,750
You all look like college students.
The intellectual kind of students.

32
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,625
How old are you?

33
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,708
I'm 69 years old.

34
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,458
You look like you're 16.

35
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,708
I'm 22 years old, but I look younger.

36
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:38,667
Pass the noodle.

37
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,375
Pass the noodle.

38
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,500
-Hold on a second.
-I can teach you. Let me see.

39
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,458
My goodness.

40
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,542
You don't have it.

41
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:46,792
A pair of Threes.

42
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,333
Who drank the soup of my noodle?

43
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,833
He did. The one wearing glasses.

44
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,792
-Shit! It's none of my business.
-I didn't drink any of it. You guys did.

45
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,125
-The one wearing glasses.
-Don't move! You fatso!

46
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,958
How did you get this scar?

47
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,208
I fell when I was drunk.

48
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,625
It looks cool, right?

49
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,625
Isn't it cool?

50
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:14,708
It is.

51
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,208
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
We regret to inform you

52
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,667
<i>that due to the weather

53
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,875
-<i>we are not able to travel any further.
-For how long?

54
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,833
<i>We truly apologize
for any inconveniences caused.

55
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,333
Hey, Qing, are you really going?

56
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,542
I hate New Years.

57
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,000
Traveling back home every year
is always a disaster.

58
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,833
The train is always crowded.

59
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,750
Either I have to hold in my pee
or I just can't drink anything at all.

60
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,625
I think Beijing is pretty nice.

61
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,083
Hey! At least I can focus
on designing my game.

62
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:43,750
But there's one problem.

63
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,667
When it rains or snows,
the traffic would get so congested.

64
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,708
That's right. Once, I had to work late

65
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,292
and the storm was pretty bad.

66
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,917
I lived at Fifth Ring Road.

67
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,625
I had to walk from the Third Ring road
because I couldn't get a cab.

68
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,792
I was so desperate.

69
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,375
But I met a guy
who was willing to give me a lift.

70
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,042
You accepted a ride
from a stranger at midnight?

71
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,000
I was miserable.

72
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,458
I would've accepted the ride
even if the driver were a ghost.

73
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,125
And then what happened?

74
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,125
The driver is now my ex-boyfriend.

75
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:11,792
-What?
-Yeah.

76
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,792
Wow. You can drink really well.

77
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,625
-Here.
-What for?

78
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,667
After all, we've survived
this snowstorm together. Hold this.

79
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,458
-You are quite romantic.
-Just take it.

80
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,083
-Come on.
-Okay.

81
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,250
What's the purpose of this?

82
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,167
-It's for you to hold on to.
-Okay.

83
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,208
Let's head back.

84
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:35,500
-You should escort her.
-Okay.

85
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,458
-Hold on.
-Let's go.

86
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,667
Finally, we are almost there.

87
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:47,167
I feel like I'm about
to turn into a popsicle.

88
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,625
<i>We have been informed by the Captain

89
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,458
<i>that due to the weather in Beijing,

90
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,875
<i>all flights for today have been canceled.

91
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:58,125
<i>Please prepare to disembark
the plane soon,

92
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:02,125
<i>Please do not forget your belongings.

93
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:06,292
Let's walk together.

94
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,917
Business class passengers,
please come forward.

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,542
-Business class passengers.
-Here.

96
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,375
Room 521.

97
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:25,542
Can you give us two separate rooms?

98
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,208
But you only have one ticket.

99
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:29,458
But there are two of us here.

100
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,833
Are you friends?

101
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,125
Do you even know each other?

102
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:36,167
Economy class passengers
can line up over here.

103
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,792
We will try our best to accommodate you.

104
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,042
Thank you.

105
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:53,958
Maybe I can go to the lobby

106
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,417
and see if there is a couch
that I can make do for a night.

107
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,875
Are you afraid of me harassing you?

108
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,917
I'm afraid that I would harass you.

109
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,625
You can get some sleep. I'm not sleepy.

110
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:14,792
It's been a while.

111
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:18,917
Every time...

112
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,750
Something bad is bound to happen
whenever we meet during New Year.

113
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:23,792
Is that so?

114
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,208
Well...

115
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,458
We used to rush back home for New Year.

116
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,083
And now,

117
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,000
we are rushing to Beijing for New Year.

118
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,083
Does Beijing make you feel like home?

119
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,000
Hey, Xiao-xiao.
Didn't your mom come with you?

120
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,042
She's oversea,
taking care of her pregnancy.

121
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,792
She found herself a foreign husband.

122
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,958
-Happy New Year!
-When will you marry and have a baby?

123
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,458
-I already have three kids.
-Xiao-xiao.

124
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:07,583
-Happy New Year!
-Xiao-xiao.

125
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,750
I called you two days ago
to change the gas pipe.

126
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,917
-I couldn't reach you.
-I changed my number.

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,458
Xiao-xiao, you're back.
Give me your address in Beijing.

128
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:15,750
-I'm getting married.
-Okay.

129
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:18,625
Xiao-xiao, you're back.

130
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,042
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

131
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,083
Happy New Year.

132
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:32,833
-Hello, Mom.
-<i>Where are you?

133
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:35,167
-I just got home.
-<i>Did you get the stuff?

134
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,583
<i>When will you have a formal address
in Beijing?

135
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:40,458
<i>It's troublesome to send you stuff
without an address.

136
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,333
No, I'm not home for chocolates.

137
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:44,792
I'm here to see Dad.

138
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,958
The New Year feast will be ready soon.

139
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,458
I'm starving.

140
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,208
It's the same dish every year.

141
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,417
There's nothing new.

142
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,458
Where are the sticky bean buns?

143
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,375
It won't feel like New Year without it.

144
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,708
I always prepare them.

145
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,083
Your high school teacher came over
for dinner the other day.

146
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,292
He mentioned that his daughter
is in the same grade as you.

147
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,417
She is now studying in Beijing.

148
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,417
-University of Political Science and Law.
-That's too far.

149
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,667
I don't want to have
a long-distance relationship.

150
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,667
It's only in Changping.

151
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,042
Is it really that far?

152
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,250
It's too far for me.

153
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,042
How about the one
that your uncle introduced to you?

154
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,375
Stop worrying about me.

155
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,625
-You should worry about yourself.
-What are you talking about?

156
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:16,333
I'm telling you.

157
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,333
You better come back here
once you have graduated.

158
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,833
There is no career in making video games.

159
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:27,917
A SPRING FILLED WITH HAPPINESS
A YEAR FULL OF PROSPERITY

160
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,667
It's not working.

161
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,750
I couldn't light this one.

162
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,875
Yes, it went off.

163
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:42,292
One more.

164
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,792
This one works.

165
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,083
Are those shoes comfortable?

166
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,583
Not really,
but the comfortable ones are so ugly.

167
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,542
Goodness.

168
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,875
You need to clear the snow off your porch.

169
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,125
-You do it.
-What?

170
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,250
-Hi, sir.
-Hey.

171
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,333
That's my dad.

172
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,167
-Have you eaten?
-Yes, I have.

173
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,000
You can always have more food
on New Year's Eve.

174
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,792
GOOD FORTUNE

175
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,917
This is Lin's best dish.

176
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,125
Here.

177
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,417
-This year, I've missed his cooking.
-Have some first.

178
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,750
This is the only picture
I had with my mom.

179
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,375
-Where are you?
-In her belly.

180
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,333
-Cheers.
-Come on.

181
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,208
My wife went to Canada before New Year.

182
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:35,583
I stayed home all by myself.

183
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,542
My daughter got married
to a man from Chongqing.

184
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,792
She won't be back until the second day
of the New Year.

185
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:40,708
Xiao-xiao.

186
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,750
How long have you been with Jian-qing?

187
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,125
-She is not my girlfriend.
-What?

188
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,417
Xiao-xiao.

189
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,167
We've all been there.

190
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,583
I just don't want you wasting time,

191
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,667
especially when it comes to
finding your other half.

192
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,958
You need to check their backgrounds,

193
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:58,333
their origins,

194
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,292
and even trace their ancestry.

195
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,250
Especially--

196
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,750
Let me finish. I'm still talking.
Don't interrupt me.

197
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,833
If I have nowhere else to go
the next New Year's Eve,

198
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:08,042
-I will come here and drink with you all.
-That's great!

199
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,875
Great!

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,375
You should come every year.

201
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:20,083
Your dad is a great cook.

202
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,917
I haven't had a good time during New Year
for a long time.

203
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:25,917
There's no one at your place.

204
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,625
Why did you go through all the trouble
of coming back?

205
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,792
I'm just finding a reason to spend time
at home during New Year.

206
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:34,042
My mom would not come back.

207
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,792
If I didn't come back,
my dad would be left alone.

208
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,375
You know, you are not like most girls
that I usually meet.

209
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,083
You curse people.

210
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,125
You know how to play cards
and you drink well.

211
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,000
What else do I not know?

212
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,750
Actually, there's quite a lot
that you still don't know.

213
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,292
I told you that it'd be hard for you
to walk in these shoes.

214
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,000
Hey, let me help you.

215
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,875
Our neighborhood...

216
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,250
hasn't changed much after all these years.

217
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,125
It's like time has stopped.

218
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,708
Sometimes, I would think of my dad...

219
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,792
because when my mom was pregnant with me,

220
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,375
my dad came back to keep her company.

221
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,500
So as a kid, I would always say to myself,

222
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,542
I will definitely get out of here
when I grow up and I'll go on my own path.

223
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,208
People say that, in Beijing,
five years is enough

224
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,042
for you to walk your own path.

225
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,750
How long have you stayed there?

226
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,625
Does four years in college count?

227
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,667
Of course not.

228
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,042
So that means I haven't started.

229
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,125
Do you like Beijing?

230
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,292
I think I'm not going to make it.

231
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,125
Nothing has really changed

232
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,875
since I first arrived four years ago.

233
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,583
Come on.
There is only one year left for you.

234
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,042
Aren't you afraid
that you'll regret it later?

235
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,833
If I had stayed for another year,
I would have made it.

236
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,125
-Is that so?
-Yes.

237
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,333
-That's what I thought too.
-Hang in there.

238
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,083
It's a new year.

239
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,375
I want to get a better job.

240
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,292
The first wish I have this year

241
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,292
is to marry a local guy in Beijing.

242
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,458
I will make it
and come back home with honor.

243
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,667
You silly!

244
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:46,625
Why go back home if you've made it?
Just stay in Beijing.

245
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,792
You're so silly!

246
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,708
<i>Living in Beijing
has always been a dream of mine.

247
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,917
<i>There's always something new here,

248
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,458
<i>someone interesting,

249
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,417
<i>and all of your dreams
can be fulfilled here.

250
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,125
<i>Even though the salary might not be much,

251
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,292
<i>and the air and water
are not as clean as in our home,

252
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,583
<i>I have to at least try.

253
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,833
<i>Or I won't be willing to return
to a small city,

254
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,250
<i>to marry someone,

255
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,208
<i>have a family,

256
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,125
-Put it on my tab.
-<i>and live an ordinary life.

257
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,875
-<i>I have to hang in there.
-Come in and take a look!

258
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,750
<i>Bring it on, Beijing!

259
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,792
<i>Who would want to leave Beijing
after graduation?

260
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,208
<i>Every time when I pass by Tiananmen,

261
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,958
<i>I think about all the wonderful things
that could happen here.

262
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:28,958
<i>I know that Beijing is not my hometown.

263
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,708
<i>I would rather embrace
the fact that I might fail in life.

264
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,833
<i>I wouldn't want to give up the chance
to go all in.

265
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,792
<i>They say that the life here is hard,
but I'm not afraid.

266
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,833
<i>At least I've been to Beijing
and have lived here.

267
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,292
<i>A day in Beijing is really short.

268
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,417
<i>It seems like the day ends
even before it begins.

269
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,000
<i>Every day when I wake up,

270
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,375
<i>I feel like my dream
is turning into reality.

271
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,542
Is this seat taken?

272
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,583
Hi. Here are your cutleries.

273
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,167
Let me introduce him.

274
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,250
He is my boyfriend.

275
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,750
His name is Yi-long Sun.

276
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,125
He has a PhD in Law.

277
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,875
He just got into the Institute of Geology,
Earthquake Administration.

278
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:20,667
PhD?

279
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,833
Your job is to dig like a groundhog
in that bureau, isn't it?

280
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,875
What do you mean by that?

281
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,833
Well...

282
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,958
-You're a handsome groundhog.
-Just ignore them.

283
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,125
Actually, my boyfriend
is not that special.

284
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,708
He is just a small-time
government officer.

285
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,625
He's managing the distribution of houses.

286
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:44,292
The house we bought is around 4,000
to 5,000 RMB per square meter.

287
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,458
It's not a big deal.

288
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,958
What do you mean by that?

289
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,083
Only 4,000 to 5,000 RMB?

290
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,708
Do you even have that much?

291
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:53,958
Do you have it?

292
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:55,583
Stop being sarcastic. Come on.

293
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,375
-Let's finish our drinks.
-You drink like a man.

294
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,292
My mom said girls shouldn't drink so much.

295
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,458
It's bad for your health.

296
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,292
I can do it. Let me.

297
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,167
Congratulations.

298
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:08,750
Xiao-xiao, you are becoming
a Beijing local.

299
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,583
Cheers.

300
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,667
How did you know each other?

301
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,208
From the internet.

302
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,833
We're virtual friends.

303
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,833
Isn't it cool?

304
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:31,958
Is it safe?

305
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,083
How old is he?

306
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:34,042
He's 27.

307
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,333
-He's 27?
-Yes.

308
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:39,792
He could pass for your dad.

309
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,208
What's wrong with you?

310
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,125
You just don't get it.
That's because I look much younger.

311
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,167
Does he treat you well?

312
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,833
Of course!

313
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,083
How exactly does he treat you?

314
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:53,167
Picking stars for you from the sky?
Bringing pearls to you from the ocean?

315
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,375
Stars?

316
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,958
Pearls?

317
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:56,958
What?

318
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,625
I mean, would he do anything for you
and give you anything you want?

319
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,292
We are in the computer business.
How can we work without electricity?

320
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,667
Young man.

321
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,833
Have some sense in you.

322
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,958
How will you make it
if your brain is useless?

323
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,333
-What did you say?
-Hey.

324
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,208
-What are you doing?
-You better watch out!

325
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:32,167
Sheng.

326
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,875
Xiao-xiao.

327
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,250
-Hey.
-You look great today. You've got a date?

328
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm meeting my boyfriend's parents.

329
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,708
Sheng, these people are from my hometown.

330
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:43,000
It's hard to make a living
here in Beijing.

331
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,000
Please help them if you can.

332
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,625
-Sure.
-Is it okay?

333
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,083
Thanks to Xiao-xiao,
I will arrange it in the afternoon.

334
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,708
Sheng, let's have drinks together.

335
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,875
-Sure. See you!
-Okay.

336
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,292
Your shoes are really pretty.

337
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,792
That was great.

338
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,375
Now you know the power of these shoes.

339
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,917
It's okay to be short.
You should be more confident.

340
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,083
I'm not wearing them for you.

341
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,708
Well, look at you two fighting.

342
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,417
Do you have feelings for her?

343
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,875
Hey.

344
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,042
Boys.

345
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,458
I need to tell you something.

346
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,875
My parents called me the other day.

347
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,083
They got me a job as one of the officials
in the county.

348
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,917
<i>I have to leave tomorrow

349
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:41,167
<i>The familiar places and you

350
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,792
-<i>My tears came flowing down
-<i>My tears came flowing down

351
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:47,083
-<i>Because of our separation
-<i>Because of our separation

352
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,042
Hello?

353
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,167
<i>I will remember your face

354
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,708
Calm down. I will be right there.

355
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,500
-<i>I will
-Okay.

356
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,542
<i>Cherish how you longed for me

357
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,958
-<i>I will keep
-Wen, I'm heading out.

358
00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:59,417
-<i>Those days
-Keep him company, okay?

359
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,542
-<i>In my heart
-Go.

360
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,917
<i>Until forever

361
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,083
What is in this? It's so heavy.

362
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,083
My shoes.

363
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,583
These are all my things.

364
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:01,875
FORTUNE, WEALTH, AND HAPPINESS

365
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,167
Goodness.

366
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,167
This room has everything.

367
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,750
You can turn on the fan if it gets hot.

368
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:50,667
Why don't you ask me what happened?

369
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:54,875
You broke up.

370
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,542
I did everything I could.

371
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,833
I even helped his mom put on her slippers.

372
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:05,333
During dinner, she gave me attitude
every time I took a bite.

373
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,458
She just wouldn't approve of us.

374
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:10,417
She said that I don't go to college
so, we'd have trouble communicating.

375
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,333
And while she was saying all that stuff,

376
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,292
he just sat there,
and didn't even say a word.

377
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,292
Damn it.

378
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,792
It sounds like you are cursing them.

379
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,417
Hell yes. I'm cursing them.

380
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,958
I finally had a stable relationship.

381
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,625
Why did she have to ruin it?

382
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:31,542
Can you stop smoking?
There's not much space here.

383
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,875
I already feel horrible.

384
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:34,542
Are you trying to suffocate me?

385
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,042
Thank you.

386
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,375
I don't want to judge you.

387
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,250
But you only focus on things
like PhD in law.

388
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,375
Housing benefits.

389
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,250
-Government officials.
-Can you mind

390
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,833
the feelings of a heartbroken person?

391
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,583
I won't get to live in a big house now.

392
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,333
So you are making fun of me.

393
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,083
College students.

394
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,167
-Can I have some of your beers?
-Sure.

395
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:08,542
Is this your girlfriend?

396
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,375
Yes, I am. Hello.

397
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,875
What do you want for dinner?
I will come by later.

398
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,125
I will still be here.

399
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:27,792
Great.

400
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:29,708
I should get going.

401
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:14,792
Listen to some music.

402
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,083
Would it help at all?

403
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:30,458
<i>How to possess a rainbow?

404
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:36,625
<i>How to embrace the summer breeze?

405
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:42,833
<i>Stars in the sky are laughing
At the people below

406
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:49,083
<i>Don't understand
Don't feel satisfied

407
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:58,458
<i>If I fall for your smile

408
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,042
<i>How to cherish it...

409
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:13,208
Do you have AutoCAD 2006?

410
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,500
AutoCAD?

411
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:15,917
Let me check.

412
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:19,417
Sir. You can go
to kiosk No. 5014 upstairs.

413
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,208
Go up that escalator.

414
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:23,167
They have a better collection.
You can try there.

415
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,083
Number 5014?

416
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,292
-Yes.
-Thank you.

417
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,958
You can't even pay rent.

418
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,125
Why did you send-off
your source of income?

419
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,042
Xiao-xiao is one of our own.

420
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,417
Hi.

421
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,833
The guy downstairs told me
you might have this.

422
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,625
AutoCAD 2006, right?

423
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,375
-The guy from downstairs?
-Yes.

424
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,708
The 2006 one is last year's version.
It's outdated.

425
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,458
I want the outdated version.
You really do have it.

426
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,083
Changyou Games.

427
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,042
They keep asking if I want to work there.

428
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,000
I think bread and butter...

429
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,708
is more important than my dreams.

430
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,042
I should accept the job.

431
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,583
Come to me next time. We have everything.

432
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,417
We have the best collection
in the whole area.

433
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,000
If you need anything, come find me.

434
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,667
I will give you a special discount.

435
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:31,250
-We are moving today. Take care.
-Goodbye.

436
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,875
-You're moving?
-Yes, I quit my job.

437
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:37,708
Hey.

438
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:39,083
Hey, you...

439
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,667
You seem to know a lot about computers.

440
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,875
I...

441
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,667
I think my computer has a virus.

442
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,125
I'll help check it later.

443
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,750
You can only reinstall the system now.

444
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:52,875
What about my stuff on the hard drive?

445
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,000
I will only format
the system's partition drive.

446
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:01,917
Who's your favorite?

447
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Aoi Sora.

448
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,500
Maria Ozawa, Maria Tagaki,
do you have them?

449
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:09,333
I got Kaede Matsushima
and Kaede Fuyutsuki.

450
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,000
Ryoko Mitake.

451
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,000
Tokiwa Sakurako.

452
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,417
Takako Kitahara.

453
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,875
Alice Ogura.

454
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:16,542
You're a pro.

455
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:21,833
Sayaka Minami, Yuka Osawa, Sanada Haruka,

456
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,792
Kyouka Ishiguro and Asuka Sawaguchi.

457
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,375
Ami Yamazaki.

458
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,875
Nami Kimura.

459
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,125
Emi Kitagawa.

460
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:32,042
-Manami Amamiya.
-Manami.

461
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:41,500
It's always nice to meet a comrade.

462
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,458
You can take this home
and practice the moves.

463
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,833
We are just friends.

464
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:51,292
Friends?

465
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:06,542
-Hey, check out these collections.
-Any hot new games?

466
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:07,542
Yes, I've got some.

467
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,375
This is a new beta version for testing.

468
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,750
Interesting.

469
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:13,125
We even have online games
and Dancin' Paradise.

470
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,375
Do you like World of Warcraft?

471
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,917
-What's gotten into you?
-It looks great, right?

472
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,750
Ugly people do strange things.

473
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,708
-This one?
-I didn't put on the wig for you anyway.

474
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,542
Here. It's lunch time. Your lunch box.

475
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:29,917
Who is it this time?

476
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,583
-The guy that bought AutoCAD from me.
-This can clean everything.

477
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:37,208
-He's been taking a lot of orders lately.
-Come and take a look.

478
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,792
He works in a state corporation.

479
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,042
He will become
the head of the division soon.

480
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:44,125
He is an influential man
and he is very nice to me.

481
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,125
Is that so?

482
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,583
Has he already bought you a house?

483
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,458
He owns one, but I haven't been there yet.

484
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:53,333
So do you like him?

485
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:55,958
Of course.

486
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:58,417
He always gives me a sense of security.

487
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,917
So are you serious about this?

488
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,667
I have always been serious.

489
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:06,333
Sir, come to us
if you want anything next time.

490
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:07,958
-Help promote us.
-Sure.

491
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:08,875
Okay?

492
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,625
He likes you with long hair.
That's why you changed it.

493
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,375
What if he likes you bald?

494
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,958
-Do you have the ones with Sora Aoi?
-Yes.

495
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,417
Not only her. We also have many others.

496
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:29,833
Sayaka Minami,

497
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,667
Sakurada Aoi, Asuka Sawaguchi.

498
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,750
We've got them all.

499
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,458
We have special ways to get them.

500
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,833
You look so familiar.

501
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,708
You kind of look like that...

502
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,250
Sakura something.

503
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:44,958
What are you talking about?

504
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,292
Get lost!

505
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,875
-Say that one more time...
-I said it.

506
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:53,375
The inspectors are here!

507
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,875
Get out of here!

508
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:59,125
Get out of here! The inspectors are here!
Move it!

509
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,792
I can pay you.

510
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:05,333
I'm going to move
into my boyfriend's house.

511
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,958
I only need the marriage certificate now.

512
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:12,167
Relax, Mom. I'm doing pretty well here.

513
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,375
Okay, bye.

514
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,875
Keep your eyes open.

515
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,250
There are a lot of liars here.

516
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,625
Don't get tricked by them.

517
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:27,958
You are just jealous.

518
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:29,292
I get it.

519
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,875
All mothers will protect their kids.

520
00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:34,458
I'm jealous of you?

521
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:38,208
Girls get in line
just so they can be with me.

522
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:39,875
Jealous, my ass.

523
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,042
Do you mean the girls in your hard drive?

524
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,667
Did you use my computer?

525
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:49,542
So you do have porn?

526
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,542
-Are you smoking again?
-No.

527
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,000
-Say it again.
-No.

528
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,042
Give me your hand.

529
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:01,875
The hand you use when you smoke.

530
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:10,167
Hurry up and leave, so I can smoke freely.

531
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,417
-Sure, let it be the death of you.
-I'll keep smoking.

532
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,083
The more you smoke, the faster you die.

533
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:15,833
Sure, I will visit you even when I'm dead.

534
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,958
Your white hair looks nice after a while.

535
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:50,042
Mom.

536
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,417
You worry about me a lot.

537
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,542
Are you falling for me?

538
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,875
Do you really think you're pretty?

539
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:05,167
Maybe a little. Sort of.

540
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,083
Not at all.

541
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,667
-Are you into me now?
-No.

542
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,833
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

543
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,750
Are you crazy?

544
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,625
-Are you crazy? Stop it!
-Don't hold back.

545
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:35,042
-They can hear you.
-Let me scream!

546
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,292
-Stop it.
-I can't take it!

547
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,167
I can't take it!

548
00:35:38,292 --> 00:35:39,417
Stay away from me!

549
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:40,750
Someone might hear you!

550
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,583
Stop screaming!

551
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:46,750
If you don't scream,

552
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,417
they might think you've passed out.

553
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,958
They might think you're weak.

554
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:52,417
Do as I say.

555
00:35:58,958 --> 00:35:59,875
I can't take it!

556
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,208
I can't take it!

557
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,250
A special discount!
Buy five and get one for free.

558
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,125
Come and have a look.

559
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,583
Come on. Smile.

560
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,208
What's wrong? No one to celebrate with?

561
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,292
My boyfriend got me a new number.
It's our love hotline.

562
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,625
I will call you from over there.
Let's try it.

563
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,042
Is it clear?

564
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:46,458
No ordinary phone can compete with it.

565
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,792
It's New Year's eve.
Why is he not with you?

566
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:51,333
He's the boss now.
He has meetings to attend.

567
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,792
Meetings on New Year's eve?

568
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,917
He is not treating you well.

569
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Of course he is. Why wouldn't he be?

570
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,708
Don't say that about him
or I'll get upset.

571
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,000
Giving you a cell phone
doesn't exactly mean he's nice.

572
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:07,875
You are really nosy.

573
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,333
Are the inspectors going to be here again?

574
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,792
Come on. Let's go celebrate.

575
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:00,375
He has a wife.

576
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:28,208
I told you it's ugly.

577
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:45,750
Come on.

578
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:58,667
Here.

579
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,625
It's 20.

580
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,833
It's five. Drink up!

581
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,625
Fuck 2007!

582
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:23,417
Fuck 2007!

583
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,000
Fuck 2007!

584
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:27,625
I think 2007 is for happy people.

585
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,667
The ones that are happy will be happier.

586
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,583
The ones that are miserable will be worse.

587
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,458
-No.
-Why not?

588
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,583
If two miserable people end up together,

589
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:37,000
they will be happy.

590
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,542
Just like my shoes.

591
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,958
It will keep getting better.

592
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:41,917
It'll keep getting tougher.

593
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:45,792
We are still young...

594
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,167
and we are pretty smart.

595
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:50,292
We won't stay poor for long.

596
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,917
We will definitely make it in the end.

597
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,542
We will be so successful.

598
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,125
Well...

599
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,083
How long is that going to take?

600
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,417
-Three years.
-I don't think so.

601
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,500
I don't think so.

602
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,292
Three years at most.

603
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,292
I don't believe it.

604
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,417
I will buy eight houses in Beijing.

605
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:12,208
I will give you one for free.

606
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:13,417
We can be neighbors.

607
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,917
If you had so many houses,

608
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,708
it would be an issue to maintain them.

609
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:23,458
It's good to just look at them.

610
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:25,875
It would make me happy.

611
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:32,250
I really think

612
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:34,333
what we have is quite nice.

613
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,458
-Right?
-Yes.

614
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,208
It's just you and me now.

615
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:49,458
Listen.

616
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:52,625
That's the countdown
to the end of us being poor.

617
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,958
The good life is just ahead of us.

618
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:56,792
Five.

619
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Four.

620
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,708
-Three.
-Two.

621
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:03,167
-One.
-Happy New Year!

622
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,833
Happy New Year!

623
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:37,417
Wait.

624
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:29,417
Hey.

625
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:31,500
What's wrong with you?

626
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,500
Leaving without saying a thing.

627
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:36,042
I've been calling you all day,
but you didn't answer.

628
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,083
Do you think this is your shelter
or a hotel?

629
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:39,917
You can come and go as you want.

630
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:41,208
What am I to you?

631
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:42,875
Do you have any respect?

632
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,625
Hey.

633
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:47,958
Are you finished?

634
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:48,875
<i>Yes!

635
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:53,042
Can we still be friends?

636
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:04,875
Did I really say that?

637
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,125
Remember the time you asked me
if we could still be friends?

638
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,875
-Yes.
-That was really cold.

639
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,458
That was your first time, right?

640
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:16,292
Did you forget?

641
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,375
You were the one
who took your clothes off first.

642
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:21,667
I did. I quickly undressed myself.

643
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,000
And then I undressed you.

644
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:24,875
You were still unsure about it.

645
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,417
You were all naked, but you had a sock on.

646
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:28,667
I didn't take off my socks?

647
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,500
Yes. You were only wearing a sock.

648
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,375
I thought that if I had sex with you

649
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:38,833
you would be with me forever.

650
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,875
I shouldn't have done it.

651
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,625
You are really lucky.

652
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,125
In your life,

653
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:47,500
you get to score someone like me.

654
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:49,000
But I came to regret it.

655
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,583
Then I won't drink with you, bastard.

656
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,542
I actually enjoyed hearing you curse then.

657
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:57,458
Say it again.

658
00:44:57,958 --> 00:44:58,833
Bastard.

659
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,500
Make it exciting.

660
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:04,250
Make it exciting?

661
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:05,542
Make it exciting.

662
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:06,917
Say something meaner.

663
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,375
Did you remember during that time

664
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,750
whenever we were going to do it...

665
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,500
I'm coming.

666
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:16,417
You liked me doing that.

667
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:19,792
I had no idea what you were doing.

668
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:23,542
After you took your clothes off...

669
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:24,750
Look.

670
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:27,667
I'm coming.

671
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:30,792
I'm coming.

672
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:33,083
You were acting like this.

673
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,625
And you're still nagging.

674
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,208
Jian-qing.

675
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:20,583
Jian-qing.

676
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,083
Jian-qing, I'm in love.

677
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,542
I haven't seen you in a while.
Jian-qing doesn't live here anymore.

678
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:32,167
Where did he go?

679
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:33,875
He's in there.

680
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:37,042
Where?

681
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:40,458
In there.

682
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:42,167
What happened to him?

683
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:46,250
Are you imitating me?

684
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:50,000
It is pretty normal in this business

685
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,083
to go in there a few times a year.

686
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:55,792
No visitors during custody. Please return.

687
00:46:55,958 --> 00:47:00,583
IN REPENTANCE, THERE IS SALVATION

688
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,250
<i>Welcome to Beijing

689
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:25,375
<i>Dreams can make you great

690
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:30,625
<i>The courage can create miracles

691
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,708
-To Beijing!
-Yes, Beijing!

692
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:35,833
If you ever go to Beijing,

693
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,292
remember to find me and Jian-qing.

694
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:39,458
You can stay at our place. It's a deal.

695
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:41,417
-Great!
-Thank you.

696
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,542
Xiao-xiao.

697
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,250
Jian-qing can't have a break on New Year?

698
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,833
Well, it's the video game convention.

699
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:49,042
Many of his colleagues wanted to go,

700
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:50,750
but his boss picked him.

701
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,542
He really misses you all.

702
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:56,750
He went shopping for gifts very early
and asked me to give them to you.

703
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,292
Uncle.

704
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,458
Jian-qing said your belt has worn out.

705
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:02,125
See. He thought about you.

706
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:04,083
Uncle.

707
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,458
You two only come home once a year.

708
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:10,208
If you didn't come, it would've been
two years since you last saw your parents.

709
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Jian-qing calls Uncle pretty often.

710
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,875
-Right, Uncle?
-Xiao-xiao.

711
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,458
How long have you been together?

712
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,792
-It has been three to four months.
-I see.

713
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:21,417
So do you guys use protection?

714
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,667
Don't be shy.

715
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,042
My line of work is about family planning.

716
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,458
Lin.

717
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:32,792
He is looking forward
to hearing your good news

718
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,208
and having a baby soon.

719
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:37,708
Only then,
New Year will be merrier, right?

720
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:39,042
Bye, Aunt.

721
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,208
Lin, I'm leaving.

722
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,833
I will come by tomorrow.

723
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,250
Is video gaming a serious job?

724
00:48:52,542 --> 00:48:54,833
Don't get your hands dirty. Don't mind it.

725
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:58,750
When he was in eighth grade,

726
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:01,833
I took him on a business trip to Beijing.

727
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:04,000
When we passed by Zhongguancun,

728
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,083
we saw a store selling authentic PC games.

729
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:09,792
Command and Conquer.

730
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,417
It was really expensive. It was 160 RMB.

731
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:17,458
Back then, my salary was less

732
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,542
than 1,000 RMB a month.

733
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,458
The next day, when I went to the bathroom,

734
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:24,875
he locked me in the bathroom.

735
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:27,333
I asked what he was doing.

736
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:29,125
He told me...

737
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,167
to buy the game.

738
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:35,333
I said I would beat the crap out of him.

739
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,292
He said that if I bought it for him,

740
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,625
it would be okay to get beaten by me.

741
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:44,792
-Then?
-I bought it.

742
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:49,167
One time, he called me while he was drunk
and said, "Thank you, Dad.

743
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:54,125
I wouldn't know what I'd be doing now
if you didn't buy that game for me."

744
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:57,292
So I was wondering.

745
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,875
He is so obsessed with gaming.

746
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,417
Did I contribute to it?

747
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:18,708
LIN'S RESTAURANT

748
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:25,917
Jian-qing.

749
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,292
Is he all right?

750
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:28,958
Yes, he is. I'll get going now.

751
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:13,375
IN REPENTANCE, THERE IS SALVATION

752
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:16,083
HAIDIAN PRISON, BEIJING

753
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:36,958
Bean buns? Sticky bean buns.

754
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,042
You went to my place?

755
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,083
Yes.

756
00:51:43,417 --> 00:51:44,917
I thought you might get caught,

757
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,708
so I pretended to be your girlfriend.

758
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:49,125
Are you crazy?

759
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,917
My girlfriend?

760
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:52,375
Why are you being

761
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:53,750
such a dick?

762
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,958
Go away.

763
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:00,542
I have good news.

764
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:01,958
I met someone.

765
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:05,250
Is he from Beijing?

766
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:06,333
No.

767
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:07,917
Does he have a house?

768
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,917
No.

769
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I will answer all the questions for you.

770
00:52:11,792 --> 00:52:13,958
Does he work in a state corporation
or in an institution?

771
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,375
Is he old?

772
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:16,625
The answer is no.

773
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:18,833
The boyfriend I have this time...

774
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:20,458
He...

775
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:22,458
is rather young.

776
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:26,458
But he doesn't have a regular job.
He looks decent.

777
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,250
Are you crazy? So are you supporting him?

778
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,583
My married ex-boyfriend
came to my shop and yelled at me.

779
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:36,625
He said that you beat him up.

780
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:39,583
No.

781
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:42,542
He came to buy some discs
and I recognized him.

782
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:55,833
Would you...

783
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:58,000
fly to the sky

784
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:01,417
or what was it? Down the ocean?

785
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,417
Pick the stars from the sky
and bring pearls from the ocean.

786
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:13,125
Come on.

787
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,708
You know that I'm your best choice.

788
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,333
You wouldn't find someone else like me
if you missed the chance.

789
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:26,250
Come.

790
00:53:34,792 --> 00:53:36,333
Two fruit pancakes.

791
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,917
I will inspect your work.

792
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,750
-Don't mess it up.
-I know.

793
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:04,958
These are the drafts of my game.

794
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:09,083
The boy in my game is called Ian.

795
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:11,583
The girl will be called Kelly.

796
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:19,917
Can you explain why this world

797
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:22,208
has never had a story

798
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,375
that is happy from the beginning
to the end?

799
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:29,958
Happiness is not a story.

800
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,750
Misfortune is.

801
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:39,583
Then I don't want to have
a story with you.

802
00:54:43,792 --> 00:54:44,750
Me neither.

803
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:46,250
Wait! Let me ask you something.

804
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:48,375
What if in your game

805
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:50,875
the boy could never find the girl?

806
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:55,792
If...

807
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:58,583
Ian could never find Kelly,

808
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,958
then the world will be colorless.

809
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,375
No.

810
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:38,583
Give me your hand.

811
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:44,458
That one.

812
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:56,125
I need to smoke a few more.

813
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:08,167
<i>Where are you, Daddy?

814
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:09,792
I'm at the hotel.

815
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:12,125
<i>Can I look at the left side of the room?

816
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:14,875
On my left?

817
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:17,500
Here.

818
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:20,833
<i>Are there any cars in the room?

819
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:23,750
<i>Now onto the right side, Daddy.

820
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:25,292
There you go.

821
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,083
<i>Hurry!

822
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:30,958
<i>A little bit more to the right.

823
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,083
There.

824
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:36,208
<i>Can you show me the entire room?

825
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:38,917
There you go.

826
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,333
<i>Show me the top part of the room, Daddy.

827
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:44,208
<i>Hurry!

828
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:47,208
Can you see?

829
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:50,667
-<i>I want to look at the bathroom, Daddy.
-The bathroom?

830
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:53,167
<i>Hurry!

831
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:54,833
<i>The bathroom.

832
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,458
-<i>I miss you so much, Daddy.
-You have a such weird habit.

833
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:05,125
Where is Mommy?

834
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,167
-<i>When will you come home?
-Hey.

835
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,625
<i>The nanny has gone back to her hometown.

836
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:13,875
<i>I'm exhausted.

837
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:16,458
I'll have to wait
until the weather is clear.

838
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:18,083
All right.

839
00:57:51,292 --> 00:57:52,208
Are you cold?

840
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:53,958
-Not really.
-What?

841
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:54,917
No.

842
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:18,458
Let's take a taxi.

843
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:21,792
Let's wait for a while.

844
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,917
One taxi ride is worth two meals.

845
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:36,375
I want to find a new job.

846
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,500
All of a sudden?

847
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,917
I can earn a lot in real estate.

848
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,708
Aren't you making a new game?

849
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:51,542
It will take some load off of us.

850
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:55,333
Didn't you often say
I'm good at making sales?

851
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,542
Let's take a taxi.

852
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:04,875
Let's wait.

853
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,375
Just wait a while.

854
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:09,417
I won't be poor for long.
Who knows maybe I will be rich tomorrow?

855
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:11,417
Taxi.

856
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,750
Beijing.

857
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,625
Can you hear me?

858
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:23,458
We will be rich soon.

859
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:26,708
We will be rich soon.

860
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,917
Beijing.

861
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,792
Can you hear me?

862
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:48,292
<i>Working is no longer
just to make a living,

863
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:51,667
<i>but it is to watch her smile
when I come home.

864
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,333
<i>Everyone has a hard time living.

865
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:56,292
<i>I can handle the suffering for her.

866
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:58,417
Hello, my number is 1009.

867
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,917
<i>Two people living in Beijing together

868
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:07,542
<i>is better than being alone.

869
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:11,042
<i>I will not only work for myself,

870
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,958
<i>but for the both of us.

871
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:39,458
<i>I'm in great pain.
I'm feeling really uncomfortable.

872
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:40,750
<i>Get home soon.

873
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:42,125
Get home soon.

874
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,375
Hey!

875
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:54,917
It's too big to fit.

876
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,917
Come on.

877
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:09,833
Don't you think we need our own couch?

878
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,750
Jian-qing is not weak anymore.

879
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:21,833
Jian-qing is not weak anymore.

880
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,542
Come here. Let's have some fun.

881
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:26,625
Quick.

882
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,208
You can try it. Feel it.

883
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:33,208
Let's have a baby.

884
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,375
I don't want children.
I'm still living my life.

885
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:39,500
-I'm still young. I'm still a child.
-You can enjoy life and still have a baby.

886
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:42,125
Do you really want children?

887
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:45,542
I want you, children, and the whole world.

888
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:49,208
Well, we are so happy together now.

889
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,917
If we break up one day,

890
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:54,958
we should never meet again.

891
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,292
No way.

892
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:58,125
I have to see you.

893
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,333
I have to know how you're doing.

894
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:02,292
No. We've broken up.

895
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:03,917
Do you really need to know?

896
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,958
-I just want to know.
-It's none of your business.

897
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:09,708
So would you want to see if I'm doing well
or doing badly?

898
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:12,958
Tell me.

899
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:16,625
I would be sad if you were miserable.

900
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,417
If you were doing well,

901
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,125
I would feel bad too.

902
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:24,208
Maybe just be like me

903
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:26,333
or a bit worse than me.

904
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,875
How can you say that?

905
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:30,042
You want your ex to do worse?

906
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,583
-That's pretty selfish.
-No.

907
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:33,542
Not at all. Think about it.

908
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,750
If I weren't the only person
who made you happy,

909
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:38,000
I would definitely be upset.

910
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:39,667
Right?

911
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:43,458
I wish time would stop now.

912
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,542
Right now.

913
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,833
Why did we break up?

914
01:03:06,417 --> 01:03:07,542
It doesn't matter.

915
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,208
What matters is that we can still
see each other afterward.

916
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,417
So how are you doing now?

917
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:18,875
So-so.

918
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,792
I sell whatever can be sold.

919
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,542
As for my love life or marriage,

920
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:26,542
I've never met anyone worthwhile.

921
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:28,667
I just broke up with one.

922
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,167
A pseudo-foreigner.

923
01:03:31,042 --> 01:03:33,167
I even took English lessons
for him for about a year.

924
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,458
I ran out of money,
but he still scammed me.

925
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:43,833
Did you really believe it?

926
01:03:43,917 --> 01:03:45,208
I'm worry about you.

927
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:46,625
You would believe everything.

928
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:49,083
You really enjoy teasing me.

929
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:52,833
And you would be glad if I were miserable?

930
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,875
I just want to know how you've been.

931
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:03,125
Actually, I got married.

932
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:05,875
I'm moving to America after New Year.

933
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:09,833
We just bought a huge house
in Beverly Hills.

934
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,917
You are lying to me again.

935
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:15,708
No, I'm not. Look.

936
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:18,125
I'm telling the truth
and you don't believe me.

937
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,292
I don't know which one is true

938
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:22,708
and which one is not.

939
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:25,000
White lies.

940
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:26,500
We both used it a lot.

941
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:39,750
-Goodness.
-What?

942
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,375
Did you rent this car?

943
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,750
What are you gloating about?

944
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,042
You spent all your bonus on this,
didn't you?

945
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,000
I borrowed some money too.

946
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,958
I spent it all on the roast duck.

947
01:04:49,042 --> 01:04:50,417
Mr. Roast Duck.

948
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:56,667
Hey, a toast to Jian-qing from Beijing!

949
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:57,708
Hey!

950
01:04:57,792 --> 01:04:59,708
Everyone gets to taste the roast duck.

951
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:01,417
It's a local specialty. I got it for you.

952
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,625
Where are you working now?

953
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:06,458
I forgot my business card.

954
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:08,292
I work with WTC Skyline.

955
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:10,500
The company has 500 employees.

956
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:12,333
It goes on IPO this year

957
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:14,583
and has a revenue of billions every year.

958
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:16,208
Billions.

959
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:17,208
For 500 people.

960
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:18,708
That's ten million each.

961
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,417
Are you nuts?

962
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:24,083
The money goes to the owner.

963
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,875
Why would he share it with 500 people?

964
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:28,042
That's also Jian-qing's share.

965
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,792
You should have your own business.

966
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:32,083
His boss wouldn't let him go.

967
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:33,542
That's quite a dilemma.

968
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,542
You should ask for Wen's help.

969
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:38,208
He said he's doing pretty well lately.

970
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:40,750
You can talk to him about it.

971
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,167
-It's fine.
-Just call Wen directly.

972
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:44,292
No.

973
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,458
It's the New Year.

974
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:46,875
I can talk to him myself.

975
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:49,083
Our classmate Huan Zheng

976
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:51,292
is now the secretary of the county mayor

977
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:53,625
and owns the biggest house of us all.

978
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,083
He has the best car too.

979
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:59,500
What's the matter with Jian-qing Lin?

980
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:02,042
We grew up together.
There's no need for him to pretend.

981
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,875
We just don't want to say the truth.

982
01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:07,083
He's still renting somewhere in Beijing.

983
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:09,167
Wait and see.

984
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:10,792
When he needs to buy a house,

985
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:12,625
go to the doctors,
or send his kids to school,

986
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,417
they will all cost him a fortune.

987
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,667
Never mind.

988
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:19,000
It's a matter of pride.

989
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,583
<i>Friends supporting each other in life

990
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:28,000
<i>Those days are gone

991
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,458
<i>A word of advice

992
01:06:29,542 --> 01:06:31,417
<i>For a lifetime

993
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,250
Drink up! Come on!

994
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,500
It was so fun back in college.

995
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:38,500
Come on.

996
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,375
-Give it to me.
-Let me pay for it.

997
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:43,417
We can pay for it

998
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,875
-Give it to me.
-We can pay for it.

999
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:46,792
-It has to be me this time.
-Let us pay for it.

1000
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:49,500
Give our old friend who came back
from Beijing a chance this time.

1001
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:50,750
Don't.

1002
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:51,958
Hand it to me.

1003
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:53,875
Come on. I've got this.

1004
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:56,000
No.

1005
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:57,833
It's fine. I've got it.

1006
01:06:57,917 --> 01:06:59,292
Secretary Zheng has already paid.

1007
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,500
We thank you for coming.

1008
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,833
One day, when you get really rich,

1009
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:06,750
remember to treat us to dinner.

1010
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,000
Okay?

1011
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,542
Don't drink too much
if you can't handle it.

1012
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,917
It's okay if you don't have money.

1013
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:31,000
You don't need to act like you do.

1014
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:33,208
Aren't you tired?

1015
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:39,458
Yes.

1016
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:45,083
I'm so tired of this place.

1017
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,750
How will...

1018
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,917
How will they look at me
if I don't pretend?

1019
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,625
I shouldn't come back here.

1020
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:03,333
Let's go.

1021
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,167
You can go with him.

1022
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:11,292
Don't let him drive the car.

1023
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:12,917
Not until he sobers up.

1024
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,750
I'll make you something for your trip.

1025
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:26,708
It's fine.

1026
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:29,083
It really is.

1027
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:35,167
Being rich, getting married,

1028
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,875
and having a house were never your goals.

1029
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:40,292
This is not the life you want.

1030
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,333
Is this not the life you want?

1031
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:46,458
But we are together now.

1032
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,667
I don't think any of that matters.

1033
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:54,000
What do you mean when you say

1034
01:08:55,292 --> 01:08:56,292
none of it matters?

1035
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:58,042
Well,

1036
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:01,833
it just doesn't.

1037
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:05,958
Why doesn't it matter anymore?
Do you think I won't be able to make it?

1038
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:07,875
Whether you make it or not,

1039
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:09,208
it's not important to me.

1040
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,833
So you are saying that I can't make it.
That is what you're saying.

1041
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:14,458
-I didn't say anything like that.
-That's what you meant.

1042
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:17,167
Think whatever you want.

1043
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,458
I didn't mean it like that.

1044
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:19,750
What exactly did you mean?

1045
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:22,042
You have to figure out what you want.

1046
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,250
What I want?

1047
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:24,958
I don't know what you want.

1048
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,833
You have to know what you want.

1049
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:29,375
It's not about what I want.
And it turns into what you want too.

1050
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,083
<i>Having a fight during New Year...

1051
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:59,708
<i>No wonder it turned out to be
a rough year.

1052
01:10:07,917 --> 01:10:09,625
<i>I've been calling for two days.

1053
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:12,167
<i>Stop talking nonsense.
Give me a refund or just charge it...

1054
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:14,167
Greetings, sir. How should I address you?

1055
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,167
<i>Address me?
Do we share the same last name?

1056
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,708
-<i>Are you my dad or what?
-Sir, please calm down.

1057
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:21,583
<i>How much do you earn in a month?

1058
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:23,125
<i>You want me to be nice?

1059
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,917
<i>Why should I be nice to you?

1060
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,333
<i>I'm spending money here.

1061
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:29,125
I'm cursing at you, you pathetic loser.

1062
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,458
You think you can be a jerk
just because you are rich?

1063
01:10:31,542 --> 01:10:34,083
Get lost if you aren't going to pay.
Suit yourself!

1064
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,125
Excuse me.

1065
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,625
Where is the customer service department?

1066
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,625
It's in there.

1067
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:47,625
May I ask?

1068
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:50,542
Who is Number 1009?

1069
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:58,958
You called me a loser?

1070
01:10:59,042 --> 01:11:00,583
The loser is here.

1071
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:02,083
Teach him a lesson.

1072
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,375
It's just women.
You should come working with me.

1073
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,542
Girls will line up for you
when you become rich.

1074
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:12,875
You wouldn't be able to shake them off.

1075
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:30,708
Why are you staring at them?

1076
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:33,583
I'm just looking.

1077
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:35,958
Are you drunk?

1078
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,458
Let's go home.

1079
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:48,708
Don't you know my nickname.

1080
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:52,083
What are you looking at?

1081
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:53,375
You had too much to drink.

1082
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:56,458
-Just ignore him.
-Let's ignore him.

1083
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:17,125
What's your problem?

1084
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,417
What's wrong with you?

1085
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,000
Do you want to fight? Then punch me.

1086
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:22,792
Do it.

1087
01:12:23,417 --> 01:12:24,458
Go ahead.

1088
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:05,750
It won't be the same price
once the subway has been built.

1089
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:07,875
The price will be doubled or tripled.

1090
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,583
There is only one reserved.

1091
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:13,292
Buying a semi-finished house is cheaper.

1092
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:15,958
If the price and location
are good for you,

1093
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:18,083
don't hesitate to buy.

1094
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,250
I think the view here is good.

1095
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:30,333
-Can I hang it here?
-Yes.

1096
01:13:31,042 --> 01:13:32,875
Hey, are you going home for New Year?

1097
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,167
Yes.

1098
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:35,792
-Hi, Uncle.
-Hi.

1099
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:44,583
Did you use my computer?

1100
01:13:44,917 --> 01:13:45,750
No.

1101
01:13:46,792 --> 01:13:48,292
It kept making sounds.

1102
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,708
So I took a look.

1103
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:52,208
The night elf is just an internet friend.

1104
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:54,167
An internet friend?

1105
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:56,542
What are you two chatting about?

1106
01:13:57,583 --> 01:13:58,958
She's in the real estate business.

1107
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:03,250
I thought if we were going to buy a house,

1108
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:04,583
it could be cheaper.

1109
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:06,292
We should get a big house,

1110
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,000
so my dad can come live with us.

1111
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:11,292
I'm an agent too. You can ask me.

1112
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:13,875
Why are you asking someone you don't know?

1113
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:15,917
What's the matter with you?

1114
01:14:37,208 --> 01:14:38,042
Hello.

1115
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:40,708
<i>I have a relative coming to stay.

1116
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:43,958
<i>Clear the house immediately.
Please move out by tomorrow.

1117
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,583
Driver, let's go.

1118
01:16:56,708 --> 01:16:57,667
Hello, Uncle.

1119
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,625
<i>Hi, Xiao-xiao. How are you doing?

1120
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,542
<i>Beijing has a lot of people
during New Year.

1121
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:04,875
Yes, it's flooded with people here.

1122
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,500
<i>Where's Jian-qing?

1123
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:08,542
<i>He's not answering his phone.

1124
01:17:15,792 --> 01:17:17,542
-<i>Jian-qing.
-Yes?

1125
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:19,750
Where will you be having dinner
for Chinese New Year?

1126
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:20,917
<i>In Beijing.

1127
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,042
<i>Dad, you're so forgetful.

1128
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,958
<i>We are having hot pot.

1129
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:26,042
<i>Barbecue.

1130
01:17:26,417 --> 01:17:27,542
<i>Roast duck. A lot of things.

1131
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:30,667
-<i>We don't need sticky bean buns anymore.
-I've saved some for you.

1132
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,542
<i>Stop worrying so much.

1133
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,375
<i>There are many people in the house, right?

1134
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:36,083
Yes.

1135
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:37,667
There are not enough chairs for them.

1136
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:39,833
<i>You don't need to worry about me.

1137
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:42,208
As long as you are doing well.

1138
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:43,583
<i>Jian-qing.

1139
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:46,542
<i>That remote control.

1140
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:51,208
I told you a hundred times
to check the batteries.

1141
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:52,833
All right?

1142
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,500
I'm going to end the call now.

1143
01:17:57,292 --> 01:17:58,583
-Dad.
-<i>Yes?

1144
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:01,750
Happy New Year.

1145
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:03,417
Yes.

1146
01:18:12,542 --> 01:18:14,333
-Here. Drink up.
-Let's drink.

1147
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:17,042
The kids are not coming home?

1148
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:18,875
He is busy with work.

1149
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:20,583
Let's drink.

1150
01:18:21,042 --> 01:18:22,375
Happy New Year.

1151
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:50,958
So you don't want to talk?

1152
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:08,125
I left some noodles for you.

1153
01:19:25,375 --> 01:19:26,625
After we break up,

1154
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:28,583
we should stop seeing each other.

1155
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,958
Jian-qing.

1156
01:19:58,833 --> 01:19:59,750
I'm leaving.

1157
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:11,667
If you didn't leave,

1158
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:13,917
would it make any difference

1159
01:22:14,917 --> 01:22:15,917
to our relationship?

1160
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,417
If at that time

1161
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:24,292
you had the courage to get on the train,

1162
01:22:25,917 --> 01:22:27,375
I would've stayed with you forever.

1163
01:22:30,667 --> 01:22:32,542
If you didn't break up with me...

1164
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:35,042
We would break up eventually.

1165
01:22:36,792 --> 01:22:38,333
If we had enough money,

1166
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:42,042
we could live in a big house with a couch.

1167
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:48,667
You would probably have ten affairs.

1168
01:22:58,292 --> 01:23:01,042
What if we just went for it
and got married?

1169
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:03,375
We would've been divorced for years.

1170
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:05,542
What if you could stay to the end with me?

1171
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:07,708
Then maybe you wouldn't make it.

1172
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:11,417
What if we didn't leave for Beijing?

1173
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:15,708
If there are no more ifs...

1174
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,000
We have everything in the end.

1175
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:29,708
Just not each other.

1176
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:01,625
Jian-qing Lin.

1177
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:03,917
You haven't gone back to Beijing?

1178
01:24:05,042 --> 01:24:05,875
Nice to meet you.

1179
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:07,792
What a coincidence.

1180
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:11,417
Congratulations on the big order.

1181
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:14,458
Get some rest.

1182
01:24:17,542 --> 01:24:18,583
Go to bed early.

1183
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,875
I don't want to go back to the room.

1184
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:36,583
Fine.

1185
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:41,292
Let's rent a car

1186
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:43,625
and drive back to Beijing.

1187
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:51,917
It's too funny.

1188
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:55,833
I could've been the wife.

1189
01:24:56,042 --> 01:24:57,542
But now I'm just the home-wrecker.

1190
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:04,250
It's a real bummer to have met you.

1191
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:08,458
The train has stopped.
The plane has stopped.

1192
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:10,500
Now the road is closed.

1193
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:12,958
Can I be more unfortunate?

1194
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:14,750
What do you want anyway?

1195
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:16,625
If it wasn't for you,

1196
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:19,417
would I spend all those years in Beijing?

1197
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:21,167
I should

1198
01:25:22,042 --> 01:25:23,417
give you an award

1199
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:25,708
for being the best ex-girlfriend.

1200
01:25:28,542 --> 01:25:30,625
Right. You should.

1201
01:25:32,792 --> 01:25:36,125
Because my good fortune
always bring luck to my ex-boyfriends.

1202
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,250
I remember my ex-boyfriend,

1203
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,792
my previous ex-boyfriend

1204
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:41,583
and another previous ex-boyfriend...

1205
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:44,792
To my knowledge, all my ex-boyfriends
are doing pretty well.

1206
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:46,125
And that is all because of me.

1207
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:47,250
I'm the kind of person

1208
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,500
who brings good fortune
to my ex-boyfriends.

1209
01:25:49,583 --> 01:25:51,625
Don't you find that very cool?

1210
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:54,125
I find it very sad.

1211
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,792
You are all alone.

1212
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:00,583
It's pretty miserable.

1213
01:26:01,292 --> 01:26:03,792
Then I think something's wrong
with your values.

1214
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:08,292
The reason I refused to leave Beijing...

1215
01:26:10,167 --> 01:26:11,917
is that I felt...

1216
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,333
if we moved back to Yaojiang,

1217
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:16,708
I couldn't see my future easily.

1218
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:19,625
Well, you can see it now too.

1219
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:21,000
You are married with children.

1220
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:23,250
You live happily.

1221
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:24,500
You have a job.

1222
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:27,542
You lead a steady life.

1223
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:29,167
You see your future very easily.

1224
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,917
Right.

1225
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:41,292
You're right.

1226
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:43,167
Jian-qing.

1227
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:44,917
Jian-qing.

1228
01:26:56,208 --> 01:26:57,250
I miss you too.

1229
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:00,083
I mean...

1230
01:27:00,917 --> 01:27:02,292
I missed you.

1231
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:17,417
I really feel like the past
is right in front of us.

1232
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:26,625
We are as childish as when we were young.

1233
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:37,125
You haven't grown-up at all you know.

1234
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,542
You haven't impressed me at all.

1235
01:27:41,875 --> 01:27:43,125
Do you know that?

1236
01:27:46,542 --> 01:27:49,500
My deepest sorrow is
I don't have the right to feel sorrow.

1237
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:56,000
And I'm...

1238
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:00,125
in no position to do anything for you.

1239
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:04,375
I don't have the right to.

1240
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:16,375
Did you even love me?

1241
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:21,208
Did you?

1242
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:35,958
I have always loved you.

1243
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,125
<i>The breakup gave me a chance to breathe.

1244
01:30:15,292 --> 01:30:17,542
<i>Staying in Beijing is like a gamble.

1245
01:30:19,042 --> 01:30:21,125
<i>Don't lose it all.
Only then you'll have a chance.

1246
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,458
<i>Although, living and not dying
are completely different,

1247
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,333
<i>I have to find a way to go all out.

1248
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:40,583
SAY SORRY FOR ME IF YOU MEET KELLY

1249
01:30:40,667 --> 01:30:42,458
What if in your game

1250
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:45,542
the boy can never find the girl?

1251
01:30:48,167 --> 01:30:50,333
<i>If Ian could never find Kelly,

1252
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:53,417
<i>then the world will be colorless.

1253

UPLOADING

1255

SAY SORRY TO KELLY FOR ME IF YOU MEET HER

1256
01:32:12,792 --> 01:32:14,500
I'M SORRY

1257
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:16,375
NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE HOW SORRY I FEEL

1258
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:18,333
SEEING THINGS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE
SADDENS ME

1259
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:19,625
HOW SHOULD I MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

1260
01:32:51,375 --> 01:32:53,042
Welcome to our team.

1261
01:32:54,083 --> 01:32:57,708
<i>The number of online players
that left sorry notes in the game

1262
01:32:57,792 --> 01:33:00,125
<i>have just passed 2 million.

1263
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:02,083
<i>On behalf of the players,

1264
01:33:02,167 --> 01:33:04,417
<i>I would like to ask,
would you like to apologize to anyone?

1265
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:07,042
<i>Of course.

1266
01:33:07,292 --> 01:33:11,083
<i>I had my doubts
when I first came to Beijing.

1267
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:13,833
<i>Wondering about my future...

1268
01:33:16,292 --> 01:33:17,250
<i>Only her.

1269
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:19,417
<i>She was the only one who believed in me.

1270
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,542
<i>I remembered that the elevator
was broken one day

1271
01:33:23,625 --> 01:33:25,708
<i>and we could only climb the stairs
to get to our room.

1272
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:26,917
<i>I said,

1273
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:28,875
"Let's tell a story.

1274
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:31,500
Because only an interesting story

1275
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:34,333
<i>can help us climb faster."

1276
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:38,333
<i>A boy called Ian

1277
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,417
<i>was separated
from his friend named Kelly...

1278
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:44,042
He thought she was abducted by aliens.

1279
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:46,542
Because she was not with him.

1280
01:33:47,542 --> 01:33:50,208
He wandered around
different planets to find Kelly.

1281
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:52,042
On his search mission,

1282
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:53,875
he had gone through
all sorts of difficulties.

1283
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:57,500
A meteor collided, a black hole opened,
and bats attacked him.

1284
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:00,708
There's a stairway that leads to heaven,

1285
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:03,208
but it never seems to end.

1286
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:07,958
-He needs to find the key to it.
-Find the key fast.

1287
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:09,750
I can't climb anymore.

1288
01:34:19,375 --> 01:34:21,208
Kelly needs to stay close to Ian.

1289
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:23,917
Ian needs to hold Kelly tight.

1290
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:25,458
So they don't get separated.

1291
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:28,417
<i>As long as Ian and Kelly are together,

1292
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,042
<i>they can travel fearlessly to all planets.

1293
01:34:37,042 --> 01:34:38,917
<i>This is the beginning of my game.

1294
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,417
Here is the living room.

1295
01:34:55,708 --> 01:34:58,083
You can have dinner here
with family and friends.

1296
01:34:58,167 --> 01:34:59,958
It would be very warm and cozy.

1297
01:35:00,042 --> 01:35:01,917
The price of this location right here

1298
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,667
will doubled

1299
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:05,083
when the subway is ready.

1300
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:06,292
And in about ten years later,

1301
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:08,375
the price will be the same
as the houses in New York.

1302
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:11,583
Then, you living in Beijing
feels just like living in America.

1303
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:13,708
You, your wife and children

1304
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,833
will have a wonderful time here.

1305
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:17,792
Actually, the happiest thing in life

1306
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:20,542
is not having money or a house
but providing a home for your family.

1307
01:35:21,208 --> 01:35:22,542
Here is the balcony.

1308
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,875
Location is really important.

1309
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:33,167
The construction and real estate company

1310
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:35,458
can tell you the class of the complex.

1311
01:35:35,542 --> 01:35:37,333
There are many good spots
around the complex.

1312
01:35:54,792 --> 01:35:55,625
Bye.

1313
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:56,542
Bye.

1314
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:09,417
JIAN-QING:
ARE YOU GOING BACK HOME THIS YEAR?

1315
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:19,250
JIAN-QING: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

1316
01:36:24,542 --> 01:36:28,583
JIAN-QING: SHOULD WE GO BACK TOGETHER?

1317
01:36:29,667 --> 01:36:32,417
MY DAD ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT YOU

1318
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:36,625
I COULDN'T TELL HIM THAT WE BROKE UP

1319
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:47,375
You don't have to look at these.

1320
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,917
Just memorize it. Look.

1321
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:50,083
For the channels...

1322
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:52,417
The is the HDMI button.

1323
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:53,917
This is for cable TV.

1324
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,458
See. There are more channels.

1325
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:56,750
This is the volume button.

1326
01:36:57,333 --> 01:36:58,542
You can try it.

1327
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:07,458
It is on, right?

1328
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,542
Closer. Get closer.

1329
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,542
You can give it another try.

1330
01:37:15,333 --> 01:37:16,750
Press this.

1331
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,792
I'll teach him.

1332
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:27,417
Why did I turn it off?

1333
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:30,458
It's on.

1334
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:32,167
Look, Uncle.

1335
01:37:32,292 --> 01:37:34,167
Never mind. Just press this button.

1336
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,125
OK.

1337
01:37:35,208 --> 01:37:36,125
OK.

1338
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:38,125
-This button is for--
-I don't want to learn it.

1339
01:37:39,417 --> 01:37:40,625
My sight...

1340
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,667
is getting worse now.

1341
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:46,167
I can't see things clearly.

1342
01:37:50,292 --> 01:37:52,167
You didn't go to the doctors?

1343
01:37:53,458 --> 01:37:55,042
I don't think it's a big deal.

1344
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:58,042
I just got old.

1345
01:37:58,667 --> 01:38:00,292
It's nothing. Don't worry.

1346
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:02,417
-Dad.
-Yes?

1347
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:05,250
After New Year, you can move in with us.

1348
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:07,167
I bought a house.

1349
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:11,667
I'll just let you young people
live together.

1350
01:38:12,167 --> 01:38:13,417
All happily.

1351
01:38:13,875 --> 01:38:15,375
There is no need to take care of me.

1352
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:18,125
Just move in with us.
I had it all decorated.

1353
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:20,542
You and Xiao-xiao can come live together.

1354
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:26,167
I'm not going.

1355
01:38:27,208 --> 01:38:28,208
Why not?

1356
01:38:28,542 --> 01:38:30,792
We can look after you if you live with us.

1357
01:38:32,375 --> 01:38:34,042
I don't need you to look after me.

1358
01:38:36,458 --> 01:38:37,750
What if you get sick?

1359
01:38:38,458 --> 01:38:40,917
Beijing has better medical treatment
than here.

1360
01:38:41,042 --> 01:38:43,167
I'm still pretty healthy.

1361
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,292
You can have your eyes checked in Beijing.

1362
01:38:48,542 --> 01:38:49,875
To see what's wrong with it.

1363
01:38:52,083 --> 01:38:53,083
Or what else would you do?

1364
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:55,542
Staying in this crappy restaurant
for the rest of your life?

1365
01:38:57,583 --> 01:38:59,208
What do you mean crappy restaurant?

1366
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:01,250
It helped me feed you,

1367
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:02,750
and paid your tuition.

1368
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:04,917
Why is it a crappy restaurant now?

1369
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,792
Then why did I leave you
and go to Beijing for?

1370
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,917
I want us to have a good life.

1371
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,292
Don't you get it?

1372
01:39:11,542 --> 01:39:12,750
That is a good life for you.

1373
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:14,708
I'm living a good life here.

1374
01:39:15,458 --> 01:39:18,958
You think you can simply arrange
other people's life when you're rich?

1375
01:39:20,542 --> 01:39:21,750
So what if I could?

1376
01:39:22,792 --> 01:39:24,167
I'll just come back once a year.

1377
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:25,750
Suit yourself.

1378
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:28,083
I'm not going.

1379
01:39:38,625 --> 01:39:39,708
You are too much.

1380
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:41,083
What's wrong with you?

1381
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:42,583
What's wrong with me?

1382
01:39:42,667 --> 01:39:43,792
What's wrong with you?

1383
01:39:44,167 --> 01:39:45,542
Don't you get it as well?

1384
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,833
I don't get it. I bought you a house.

1385
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:53,042
I bought my dad a house.

1386
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:54,333
I thought you would be happy.

1387
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:57,083
Did I do anything wrong?

1388
01:39:57,667 --> 01:39:58,583
No, you didn't.

1389
01:39:58,667 --> 01:39:59,833
You are so right.

1390
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:02,708
The reason why I dated you
is that you could afford a house.

1391
01:40:02,833 --> 01:40:05,417
Your dad raised you for 20 years
because all he wants is a house.

1392
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,042
When I got my first paycheck,

1393
01:40:11,125 --> 01:40:12,917
I went straight to find a house. Why?

1394
01:40:13,042 --> 01:40:14,000
Just because...

1395
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:20,583
Never mind.

1396
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:21,750
Say it.

1397
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:26,500
Just because I didn't have a house...

1398
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:31,750
I didn't break up with you
because of that.

1399
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,583
I wanted a home.

1400
01:40:34,167 --> 01:40:35,208
I know.

1401
01:40:35,625 --> 01:40:37,667
I know you wanted my love and a home.

1402
01:40:37,792 --> 01:40:39,417
I can do it now, Xiao-xiao.

1403
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,375
I got the money. I got the house.

1404
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:43,208
I can give you an address in Beijing.

1405
01:40:43,333 --> 01:40:44,375
I can fulfill your wish.

1406
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:45,792
Can't this be considered as love?

1407
01:40:51,292 --> 01:40:52,125
Xiao-xiao.

1408
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:54,042
Xiao-xiao.

1409
01:40:55,208 --> 01:40:56,583
You have someone else, don't you?

1410
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:03,875
Are you out of your mind?

1411
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:13,333
I'm sorry.

1412
01:41:15,125 --> 01:41:16,125
I'm sorry.

1413
01:41:16,292 --> 01:41:17,458
I didn't mean that.

1414
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:25,583
Please give me another chance.

1415
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,542
I will do my best.

1416
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,375
If you thought back then

1417
01:41:33,417 --> 01:41:35,333
I couldn't endure
the tough times with you,

1418
01:41:35,917 --> 01:41:38,583
why would you assume that I could live

1419
01:41:38,667 --> 01:41:40,625
the good life you wanted with you now?

1420
01:41:48,333 --> 01:41:50,458
Xiao-xiao, I really don't understand you.

1421
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:53,583
You never did.

1422
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:56,458
You never did.

1423
01:42:00,625 --> 01:42:03,292
I tried really hard to become
what you want me to be.

1424
01:42:09,417 --> 01:42:12,042
But I'm not the same person now.

1425
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,500
Can we make it home?

1426
01:43:08,125 --> 01:43:09,375
Just like my dad said,

1427
01:43:10,542 --> 01:43:11,542
"Wherever we go,

1428
01:43:12,958 --> 01:43:14,292
we are the outsiders."

1429
01:43:17,792 --> 01:43:19,750
When my dad passed away,

1430
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:22,292
he was still thinking about you.

1431
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:36,333
Dad.

1432
01:43:37,667 --> 01:43:40,083
-Jian-qing.
-Why did you come here?

1433
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:47,333
Xiao-xiao is back.

1434
01:43:54,417 --> 01:43:55,500
Are you hungry?

1435
01:43:56,125 --> 01:43:57,083
Let's go home.

1436
01:43:57,875 --> 01:43:58,875
Hold my dad.

1437
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,333
I was driving one day,

1438
01:44:27,417 --> 01:44:29,292
and I saw you in a red sports car.

1439
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:33,000
I followed you everywhere.

1440
01:44:34,042 --> 01:44:36,208
You were going too fast,
I couldn't catch up.

1441
01:44:37,708 --> 01:44:39,333
It would be great if I caught up with you.

1442
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:43,208
The red sports car. Remember?

1443
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:46,583
I promised I'd buy two of them for you.

1444
01:44:46,917 --> 01:44:48,292
You could take turns to drive them.

1445
01:44:57,375 --> 01:44:59,583
I never drove any red sports car before.

1446
01:45:01,583 --> 01:45:03,125
You missed me too much.

1447
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:05,208
So it was just your imagination.

1448
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:41,792
Time to leave.

1449
01:45:57,875 --> 01:46:00,333
We always parted in a hurry.

1450
01:46:01,167 --> 01:46:02,042
This time,

1451
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:03,625
let's bid our farewell properly.

1452
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:06,375
Jian-qing Lin.

1453
01:46:06,583 --> 01:46:07,417
Goodbye.

1454
01:46:09,542 --> 01:46:10,625
Xiao-xiao Fang.

1455
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:11,917
Goodbye.

1456
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:15,833
Pick the stars from the sky,

1457
01:46:16,417 --> 01:46:17,792
bring the pearls from the ocean.

1458
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:21,792
You will.

1459
01:46:22,583 --> 01:46:23,625
You will find that person.

1460
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,750
We're going to be fine.

1461
01:46:43,458 --> 01:46:44,583
That's right.

1462
01:47:39,458 --> 01:47:42,417
TO: XIAO-XIAO

1463
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,042
I'm telling you.

1464
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:46,708
You need to take care of
Yang-yang's school admission.

1465
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:49,250
Kindergartens in Beijing
are hard to get in now.

1466
01:47:49,333 --> 01:47:51,208
Whether Yang-yang
goes to a good school or not,

1467
01:47:51,292 --> 01:47:52,417
it all depends on you.

1468
01:47:54,917 --> 01:47:57,375
BEIJING TO YAOJIANG
TO: MS. FANG

1469
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:01,583
BEIJING TO YAOJIANG

1470
01:48:01,667 --> 01:48:05,500
TRAIN TICKET FROM BEIJING TO YAOJIANG

1471
01:48:16,625 --> 01:48:18,042
Hi, Ms. Fang.

1472
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:19,458
-Yes.
-For you.

<i>Xiao-xiao.

1474
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:39,625
<i>It's almost New Year.

1475
01:48:41,292 --> 01:48:43,375
<i>I just made two stacks
of sticky bean buns.

1476
01:48:44,167 --> 01:48:45,458
<i>When I took them out of the pot,

1477
01:48:46,542 --> 01:48:47,833
<i>the smoke covered my eyes.

1478
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:52,292
<i>I've still kept a stack for you this year.

1479
01:48:54,125 --> 01:48:55,500
<i>I always tell you two

1480
01:48:56,167 --> 01:48:58,792
<i>that home cook meals are the best.

1481
01:48:59,208 --> 01:49:01,167
<i>The food out there just can't compare.

1482
01:49:03,375 --> 01:49:05,667
<i>I always wanted to send some food to you.

1483
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:08,000
<i>I can't ask Jian-qing about it.

1484
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:10,875
The television is broken, Dad. Look.

1485
01:49:10,958 --> 01:49:13,167
I'll be there right away.

1486
01:49:15,833 --> 01:49:18,917
<i>Lately, he seemed more mature.

1487
01:49:20,042 --> 01:49:22,583
<i>And I know it was because of you.

1488
01:49:24,625 --> 01:49:26,000
<i>About fate,

1489
01:49:27,417 --> 01:49:29,417
<i>as long as you don't fail each other,
that's enough.

1490
01:49:30,958 --> 01:49:34,167
<i>It is really hard to spend
your whole life together.

1491
01:49:36,708 --> 01:49:40,250
<i>You may have to get older

1492
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,375
<i>to understand such feelings.

1493
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:48,375
<i>As a parent, whom you choose to be with,

1494
01:49:49,167 --> 01:49:52,708
<i>or whether you make it or not,
doesn't really matter.

1495
01:49:54,375 --> 01:49:58,083
<i>I just hope you can live the life you want

1496
01:49:59,333 --> 01:50:00,542
<i>and stay healthy.

1497
01:50:04,958 --> 01:50:07,583
<i>Now that I'm old and can barely see,

1498
01:50:09,458 --> 01:50:12,042
<i>Jian-qing keeps saying
that I know nothing.

1499
01:50:17,542 --> 01:50:18,875
<i>That year at the train station,

1500
01:50:21,125 --> 01:50:24,125
<i>I thought I was holding your hand,

1501
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:26,833
<i>but it wasn't you.

1502
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:29,708
Xiao-xiao is back.

1503
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:34,083
Come on. Let's go home.
It's good to have you back.

1504
01:50:35,792 --> 01:50:37,167
<i>I realized it then.

1505
01:50:37,917 --> 01:50:40,250
<i>Even if you two couldn't make it
as a couple,

1506
01:50:41,042 --> 01:50:42,625
<i>we would still be a family.

1507
01:50:45,417 --> 01:50:46,500
<i>Xiao-xiao,

1508
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:48,667
<i>take care of yourself.

1509
01:50:49,542 --> 01:50:50,958
<i>Come home anytime when you're tired.

1510
01:51:09,042 --> 01:51:15,167

1511
